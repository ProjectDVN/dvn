* Native compilation
* Visual novel features like characters, dialogues, options, animations, music, sound effects etc-
* And much more ...

### Building

Please visit the example repo for guides on how to build the engine and/or how to develop your visual novel.

The repo can be found here: https://github.com/ProjectDVN/Example

### Events

To control most of the engine there are a set of events that can be called.

Simply define a class like below:

```d
public final class Events : DvnEvents
{
	import zid;
	import dvn.views.gameview;

	public:
	final:
	// override events here ...
}
```

Then override the event functions you need.

Ex.

```d
public final class Events : DvnEvents
{
	import zid;
	import dvn.views.gameview;

	public:
	final:
	override void renderGameViewCharacterName(SceneCharacterName characterName, Label label, Panel panel)
	{
		panel.position = IntVector(150, 150); // The name panel will always be displayed at 150x150
	}
}
```

Afterwards call the function `DvnEvents.setEvents(new Events);` to set the events.

This can be called in your main function (In most cases it will be called mainEx)

```d
// Global

void renderActTitleLabel(Label label) {}

void renderActBeginLabel(Label label) {}

// Called when the act view has been displayed
void endActView() {}

// Game View

void loadingGameScripts() {}
// Called when the scripts has been loaded
void loadedGameScripts(SceneEntry[string] scenes) {}

// Called when a scene is being handled
void beginHandleScene(SceneEntry scene, SceneEntry nextScene, bool isEnding) {}
