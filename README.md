## Core Philosophy

Project DVN is built from what visual novels actually do, not from what engines typically offer.

Most engines are built like this:

* Engine -> Featres -> VNs must fit those features

DVN is the opposite

* Visual novels -> Real-world behavior -> DVN implements those behaviors

## Current Features
